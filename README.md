# advent_of_code_2021

Repo for advent of code 2021 in clojure. I assumed that each day would build on
the previous but 3 days in and I'm realizing that wasn't the case. So for now
I'm putting code for each day in it's own ns with very little shared code
between.

Code is copied from previous days where useful instead of moving into a common
place, since I don't know when it might need to change in a way that would break
the answer for an earlier day.

In some cases (it's happened on day 2 already) the ask is to change the code in
task 2 that is required to get the correct answer for task 1, so occasionally
functions may get copied within a file as well.

For the most part there's a comment block at the bottom of each day that has
`tests` for the correct answers. I'm doing this instead of actual test
namespaces for simplicity, it might be worthwhile to move them all to actual
test files later... I'm writing this on day three, so who knows what will happen
by the end.
